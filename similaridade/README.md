# Similarities

This project aims to help in situations where it is necessary to find the similarity (In %) in string values, ​​between two dataframes.

## Reference

 - [IBGE](https://www.ibge.gov.br/)

## Appendix

To develop it, I used a generic base with values ​​of unstructured Brazilian cities and a base taken from the IBGE with the correct names of these cities. With the two bases, I compare line by line looking for similarities between the two. The function created to perform the search accepts a float value, which serves to define the % of similarity accepted to, in the generic base, return the value (In the base itself) of the correct municipality.
