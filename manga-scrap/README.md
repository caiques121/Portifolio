# Mangá Scrap

On Christmas 2021 I bought a kindle because I like to read manga and I would like to read them anywhere with a reasonably large screen. However, the native manga from amazon catalog is not very large and I know there are sites to do this reading online.

Behold, this project appeared! I created algorithms that go (Using Selenium) into these online manga reading sites, download and organize the .jpgs of the pages, and create organized pdfs of the chapters with the name of the chapter itself in the filename.

At the moment, I have created two scripts, one that runs from a One Piece mangá project website and the other that runs from chapter -16 of Berserk. However, this second, works with any mangá on this site, you just need to start from the chapter you need.
